Okay, when you need it, I assume you totally dont know what I am trying to say /mention in the story.(It is certainly my problem if it is happened, which means I have the responsibility to do the things for that).
Or if you want to see this after you finished the story, if you feel the story is interesting, I will be extremely happy. As the whole story of Epiphyllum is my work.


Talk about the core part first, the truth of this story, as mentioned at the begining, is choose by the player. But when they choosed one side which is (unless leave the space of uncertain), which means there is another
side is not the truth(logically). 

But there are two major watersheds for the logical element of this story.

1. Magic is existed/Shirley is existed
2. Magic is not existed/ Shirley is player illusion

1. Aya& Kallen slept with player
2.Aya& Kallen havent slept with player




Although in Epiphyllum we know Cheresa is lying.
However, we just can confirm that world line is different with Fatality, as Fatality mentioned the news reported there are three girls died.


**which means logically  Epiphyllum <-> Fatality is hiddenly saying both of them are in different logical watershed.

Although in the perspective of Epiphyllum, player finally also cannot confirm how many lies she said, but few things player can confirm which is:

1.  Cheresa feeling upset is not because of Aya/Kallen dead  (Masqueraded)
2. Cheresa feeling upset is not because of Aya/Kallen (mentioned from her) take a step back from her


Cheresa feel upset is keep mentioned for many many times already (and there is no evidence to proof she is also masquerading), so the possisbility of Cheresa upset is:

 1.Aya& Kallen slept with player
 2.Cheresa killed Aya/ Kallen in Epiphyllum world line


The first one, it is not tricky to think it might be happen, as start from the introduction, Cheresa is showing she loves player already
But the second, Why I think it might be a possisbility, as in the world line of Epiphyllum, the "news" is fake.
So why Cheresa will mention about the news and why in OccupiedThinking will acting like that.

From my perspective is she killed Aya/Kallen in this world line, and the reaction after the "cases" happen is PTSD

it also could explain why in OccupiedThinking Cheresa's reaction will start becoming different.


From logical perspective, only the world line in MemoryPieces could be confirmed there is a contrast - must have one side is dream.

others are quite blur.
